### RFM stands for the three dimensions:

Recency – How recently did the customer purchase?<br>
Frequency – How often do they purchase?<br>
Monetary Value – How much do they spend?<br>

Before starting RFM analysis we need to set objective and outcome of analysis, for this example goal is to define class of customer example - Platinum, Gold and Silver.

Platinum customer - frequent and more revenue generator.<br>
Gold customer - frequent but less revenue generator.<br>
silver customer - less frequent and less revenue generator.<br>
